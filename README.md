2. Set up the Development Environment, you can see the Edison Getting Started Guide.
3. Download the library and demo from github
4. Open Arduino IDE. Click *Tools* > *Board* and select *Intel® Edison*
5. Click *Tools* > *Serial Port* and select the *Com #* that the Intel Edison is connected to
6. Click *Sketch* > *Import Library…* > *Add Library* and import the library downloaded at step 3
7. Click *File* > *Examples* > *Grove_Indoor_Environment_Demo* and select the demo
8. Click the upload icon
9. Open *Tools* > *Serial Monitor*, it will print the sensors’ information:

10. Rotate the *Encoder* to check the sensor value on the LCD.

11. In the *Send TextBox*, you can enter the following command to operate the sensors and actuators:
***Note:set [sensor][condition:>, < or =][ threshold],[actuator]=[action]***

Example | Description
-------------------------- | -----------------------
set temp>40, relay=1 | if temperature is higher than 40°C, the relay opens.
set temp>40, sleep=1 | if temperature is >40°C, nothing to do.
set humi>60, buzzer=1 | if humidity is >60%, the buzzer beeps.
set light>600, servo=90 | if light intensity is >600, the servo truns 90°.
set uv>80, relay=0 | if UV intensity is >80, the relay closes.
set pir=1, buzzer=1 | If people detected, the buzzer beeps.
set ms>40, relay=1 | if moisture is >40, the relay opens.
set ssid=name, psw=password | set the wifi SSID and Password.

You can open a web browser, and go to the IP address displayed on the *Serial Monitor* or *LCD*. The default port is `88`.
Such as: `192.168.1.101:88`

Note: 1. The command should be ended with `/n`, so “NewLine” (in the *Serial Monitor*) should be selected.
     2. A actuator can only be controlled by a sensor. If A sensor wants to control a actuator (has be controlled by B sensor), B sensor should be set sleep.

## Example: Automatic Pot-Watering

This example uses a *Grove - Moisture Sensor* to detect the pot soil moisture and *Grove – Relay* to control a water-pump. When the moisture is lower than the threshold, the relay will open and the pump works until the moisture is higher than the threshold.

### Instructions:
1. Connect the device as above, and connect the water-pump:

2. While connected, open the *Serial Monitor*,and send the command,as follows:

3. Insert the *Grove - Moisture Sensor* into your pot, check the moisture value on the LCD.

4. WiFi connection. open the *Serial Monitor*, and send the command as follows. Check the local IP on the *LCD* or *Serial Monitor*. On a device connected on the same network, open a web browser, and go to the IP address above, you can see the sensor value.
